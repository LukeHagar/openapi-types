When designing types, avoid using atomic types. Through the process of investigating the type signatures for OpenAPI I determind that some types are too different to encompass with a common base, and results in a much more complex type signature.

The goal is for the types to be as easily consumable as possible, and be extremely detailed and specific to the OpenAPI specification version they represent.
