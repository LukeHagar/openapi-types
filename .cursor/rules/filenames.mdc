Please prefer simpler filenames

For example, prefer string.ts over string-schema.ts

All the top level keys for OpenAPI should have their own file, except for the OpenAPI key, which should be included in the root level specification file directly

below is an example for OpenAPI format, but the same principles apply to Swagger 2.0
The files for each spec should be as follows:
- Info | info.ts
- Servers | servers.ts
- Paths | paths.ts
- Components | components.ts
- Security | security.ts
- Tags | tags.ts

Additional files should be created for the sub keys that require more detail:
- ExternalDocs | externalDocs.ts not external-documentation.ts
- Extensions | extensions.ts
- References | references.ts
- Callbacks | callbacks.ts
- Webhooks | webhooks.ts
- Parameters | parameters.ts
- RequestBodies | requestBodies.ts
- Responses | responses.ts
- XML | xml.ts

This philosophy should be applied to similar ideas and formats, and you should prioritize accurate, consistent, clean, descriptive, and detailed names, descriptions, patterns, and organization.
